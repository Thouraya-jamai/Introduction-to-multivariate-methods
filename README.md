# Introduction-to-multivariate-methods
# Exercise1:
  1. create the data matrix and named stat
  2. Change the order of the columns (year, governorate, population) and display the new result
  3. Create a new data matrix from stat, called stat2, by changing the row index (alphabetical number instead of numeric) and adding another initially empty Job variable.Then fill in the Employment column     with the value 16.5
  4. Add another variable to stat2, named North, filled with True for the northern governorates and False otherwise.Then delete this variable.
  5. #delete the variable 'North'

# Exercise2:
  1. import the file "donnees_enquete_2003_television(1).txt"
  2. Remove empty columns
  3. Get the distinct values ​​for the cLT2FREQ column
  4. Modify the matrix to remove the rows for which the time unit (cLT2FREQ) is not specified or equal to zero
  5. Save the result in Excel format

# Exercise3:
  1. create the data matrix
  2. Determine the line vector of the arithmetic averages of the grades of three subjects
  3. Determine the line vector of the arithmetic ranges of the grades of three subjects
  4. Determine the line vector of the arithmetic medians of the grades of three subjects
  5. Calculate the Y matrix of centered data and the Z matrix of centered and reduced data
  6. Calculate the RX matrix of the correlations of our data matrix and the VZ matrix of the variances and covariances of Z.
